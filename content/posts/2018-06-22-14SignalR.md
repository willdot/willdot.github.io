SignalR is something that I've seen pop up a few times but until this week I've never really taken a good look at it. I found an article about how it was now included as standard within the ASP .Net Core 2.1 SDK, and as I had just installed that, I decided now was the time to take a look.

After reading a few blog posts on how others had used it, it became apparent that most people use it for messaging apps. So after I created a very simple example of it working, I decided to be different and use it for something else. After scratching my head, I decided to make a simple stock control app.

A client web app that allows the user to select items from a list, see how many are in stock and then manually add or subtract stock for that item. Then when an items stock gets below 5, an alert it sent out to all connected clients to show that an item was low in stock, and if an items stock hits 0, another alert sent out to indicate this as well.

## Technology used
### Back end
* ASP .Net Core 2.1
* SignalR Core

### Front end

* Angular 6
* aspnet/signalr
* primeng

## How to

### Back end first

First thing I did was create a fresh out the box, ASP .Net Core web API app.

Next, for dependency injection purposes, I created an interface for my SignalR client that contains a method for sending a message. 

``` c#
public interface IStockClient
{
    Task BroadcastMessage(string value); 
}
```

Next I created a hub class. This class is what's used by SignalR as a hub for sending messages. A hub is like a server; clients can connect to multiple hubs, and each hub will provide it with different data. So I created a StockHub that will be used by the web clients to connect to so that they receive messages about stock. It inherits the SignalR Hub base class passing through my interface as the client. I also added a very simple method that will send out a message to all clients.

``` c#
public class StockHub : Hub<IStockClient>
{
    public async Task Send(string value) => await Clients.All.BroadcastMessage(value);
}
```

The next thing I did was add in some code to the StartUp class. I added in Cors and then added SignalR as a service as well as setting the SignalR routes. This route is what is used to connect to the hub. The client, will make a connection to the hub at the URL http://localhost:1234/stock It is key that there is a leading forward slash when setting the route!!!

``` c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddCors(o => o.AddPolicy("CorsPolicy", builder => {
        builder
        .AllowAnyMethod()
        .AllowAnyHeader()
        .AllowAnyOrigin()
        .AllowCredentials();
    }));

    services.AddSignalR();
}

// This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseCors("CorsPolicy");
    app.UseSignalR(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapHub<StockHub>("/stock");
    });

    app.UseMvc();
}
```
Next it was time to set up some models and fake data.

First I created an input class that would be used to model the post object, and then another class that would be the model for a stock item.

``` c#
public class StockInput
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Amount { get; set; }
}
```
``` c#
public class StockItem
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Amount { get; set; }
}
```

As this was only a demo project, and I wouldn't be connecting to any form of data source, I needed a singleton service for storing data that I would fake upon launching the API. So I created an interface for this and a class that implemented this, so that I could inject it as a singleton service in the startup class.

A list of the data that I would fake, and some methods for manipulating that data.
``` c#
 public interface ITempData
{
    List<StockItem> Stock { get; }

    void AddStock(StockItem input);
    void RemoveStock(StockItem input);

    int GetStock(string item);
}
```
In here I create a static list of data and in the constructor I add some fake data. Then the rest of the methods use logic to add or remove stock, throwing exceptions when stock is not available or the item doesn't exist.
``` c#
public class TempData : ITempData
{
    private static List<StockItem> _stock = new List<StockItem>();

    public List<StockItem> Stock
    {
        get
        {
            return _stock;
        }
    }

    public TempData()
    {
        _stock.Add(new StockItem() { Name = "Water", Amount = 5 });
        _stock.Add(new StockItem() { Name = "Coffee", Amount = 2 });
        _stock.Add(new StockItem() { Name = "Chocolate", Amount = 10 });
    }

    public void AddStock(StockItem input)
    {
        if (_stock.Count(p => p.Name == input.Name) == 0)
        {
            _stock.Add(input);
        }
        else
        {
            _stock.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == input.Name).Amount += input.Amount;
        }

    }

    public void RemoveStock(StockItem input)
    {
        // Not something that is currently stocked
        if (_stock.Count(p => p.Name == input.Name) == 0)
        {
            throw new Exception("Item not stocked");
        }
        // There is nothing left of this item
        else if (_stock.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == input.Name).Amount <= 0)
        {
            throw new Exception("Out of Stock");
        }
        // The amount that has been requested to be removed is more than what's available
        else if(_stock.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == input.Name).Amount < input.Amount)
        {
            throw new Exception("Stock amount less than required amount");
        }
        // In stock and the requested amount is available to be removed
        else
        {
            _stock.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == input.Name).Amount -= input.Amount;
        }
    }

    public int GetStock(string item)
    {
        if(_stock.Count(p => p.Name == item) > 0)
        {
            return _stock.FirstOrDefault(p => p.Name == item).Amount;
        }

        throw new Exception("not currently stocked");
    }
}
```
Then back to the startup class and I added in this to the dependency injector.
``` c#
services.AddSingleton<ITempData, TempData>();
```

Finally it was time to create the controller for all of this. It contains a get method to get the current stock, a post method for adding stock, and another post method for removing stock. (Yes I know post should only be used for creating data, but this is just a demo app).

Finally there is a method for sending out a message using SignalR (the star of this show!!!).

``` c#
[Route("api/[controller]")]
[ApiController]
public class StockController : ControllerBase
{
    private IHubContext<StockHub, IStockClient> _context;
    private ITempData _tempData;

    public StockController(IHubContext<StockHub, IStockClient> hub, ITempData tempData)
    {
        _context = hub;
        _tempData = tempData;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public  ActionResult<IEnumerable<string>>Get()
    {
        return Ok(_tempData.Stock);
    }

    [HttpPost("add")]
    public ActionResult AddStock([FromBody] StockInput input)
    {
        if (input.Name == "")
        {
            return BadRequest("Item name missing");
        }

        StockItem item = new StockItem()
        {
            Name = input.Name,
            Amount = input.Amount
        };

        _tempData.AddStock(item);
        return Ok();
    }

    [HttpPost("remove")]
    public ActionResult RemoveStock([FromBody] StockInput input)
    {
        StockItem item = new StockItem()
        {
            Name = input.Name,
            Amount = input.Amount
        };

        try
        {
            _tempData.RemoveStock(item);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            return BadRequest(ex.Message);
        }

        SendStockMessage(input.Name);

        return Ok();
    }

    private void SendStockMessage(string item)
    {
        try
        {
            int stockAmount = _tempData.GetStock(item);

            if (stockAmount == 0)
            {
                _context.Clients.All.BroadcastMessage($"Item: {item} is out of stock");
            }

            if (stockAmount <= 5)
            {
                _context.Clients.All.BroadcastMessage($"Item: {item} has {stockAmount} in stock");
            }
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _context.Clients.All.BroadcastMessage($"Item: {item} {ex}");
        }   
    }
}
```

The post methods simple call the fake data methods to update the stock, catching the exceptions if there is no stock. The fun part of this code is the SendStockMessage method. It works out if the item that was updated is low on stock and if it is, a message is sent.

A IHubContext dependency is passed in, with our Hub class instance as well as our client interface which contains the method for sending a message to our clients. So when a message needs to be sent, we send call the BroadCastMessage method that sends a string value and any clients connected, will receive the message.

### Now for the frontend

The front end is an Angular 6 app. Nothing too fancy looking, but the cool messages received from the hub make up for it. 

I created a new CLI project and added in some packages (bootstrap, @aspnet/signalr, primeng and primeicons).

I created a routing file that would contain my routes for the app.

``` typescript
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { StockComponent } from './stock/stock.component';

const appRoutes: Routes = [
    { path: 'stock', component: StockComponent },
    { path: '', component: StockComponent},

    // otherwise redirect to home
    { path: '**', redirectTo: '',  }
];

export const routing = RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes);

```

Then in the app module I imported this along with the FormsModule, GrowlModule (from the primeng package) and finally the HttpClientModule.

Then in the app.component.html file, I added in the growl component which would show the notification messages.

``` html
<p-growl [(value)]="msgs"></p-growl>
<div class='container'>
        <router-outlet></router-outlet>
    </div>
```

In the app.component.ts file I then configured the SignalR connection and assigned the messages received to the growl component. I am doing this on the app component, so that it will show notifications globally on the site. If you want to add them to only particular pages / components, nest as necessary.

In here, in the OnInit method, I create a new connection the the back end hub created earlier, start it up and then tell the connection, then when a 'BroadcastMessage' method is called in the hub (remember that's what we called the method in the IStockClient interface), then the value we receive from that, push it to the growl components messages. This will then show a new notification to the user.

``` typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { HubConnection, HubConnectionBuilder } from '@aspnet/signalr';

import { Message } from 'primeng/api';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})

export class AppComponent implements OnInit {

  private _hubConnection: HubConnection;
  msgs: Message[] = [];

  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(): void {

    this._hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl('https://localhost:44398/stock')
    .build();

    this._hubConnection
    .start()
  .then(() => console.log('It started'))
  .catch(err => console.log('Error'));

    this._hubConnection.on('BroadcastMessage', (value: string) => {
      this.msgs.push({summary: value});
    });
  }
}
```

Finally, I created a stock component and service that would interact with the API to add and remove stock, so that the messages would appear on the clients.

``` typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClient, HttpErrorResponse, HttpHeaders } from '@angular/common/http';
import { Observable, throwError} from 'rxjs';
import { map, takeUntil, tap } from 'rxjs/operators';
import { StockItems } from '../models/StockItems';


@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class StockService {

  constructor(private _http: HttpClient) { }

  AddStock(item: StockItems): Observable<any> {
    console.log('lets post');
    const input = {
      name: item.name,
      amount: ''
    };

    const body = JSON.stringify(item);
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    const options = {headers: headers};
    return this._http.post<any>('https://localhost:44398/api/stock/add', body, options)
    .pipe(
      tap(
        data => console.log(data),
        error => this.handleError(error)
      )
    );
  }

  RemoveStock(item: StockItems): Observable<any> {
    console.log('lets post');
    const input = {
      name: item.name,
      amount: ''
    };

    const body = JSON.stringify(item);
    const headers = new HttpHeaders({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
    const options = {headers: headers};
    return this._http.post<any>('https://localhost:44398/api/stock/remove', body, options)
    .pipe(
      tap(
        data => console.log(data),
        error => this.handleError(error)
      )
    );
  }

  GetStock(): Observable<StockItems[]> {
    console.log('Lets get some stock');

    return this._http.get<StockItems[]>('https://localhost:44398/api/stock/')
    .pipe(
      tap(
        data => console.log(data),
        error => this.handleError(error)
      )
    );
  }

  private handleError(err: HttpErrorResponse) {
    if (err.statusText != null) {
      console.log('Something bad happened');
        console.log(err.statusText);
    }
    return throwError(err.status);
  }

}
```

``` html
<div class='container'>
    <label>{{errorMessage}}</label>
</div>

<div class='container'>
    <div class='label'>Item</div>
    <select [(ngModel)]='item' id='item' (change)='onSelectedItem($event.target.value)'>
        <option *ngFor='let item of items' [value]='item.name'>{{item.name}}</option>
    </select>
    {{itemAmount}}
</div>

<div class='container  col-md-2'>
    <label>Amount</label>
    <input type='number' ng-readonly='true' class='form-control textBox' [(ngModel)]='requestedAmount'>
</div>

<div class='container'>
    <button (click)='onRemoveStockClicked()'>Request Stock</button>
    <button (click)='onAddStockClicked()'>Add Stock</button>
</div>
```

``` typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { StockService } from '../services/stock.service';
import { StockItems } from '../models/StockItems';
import { HttpErrorResponse } from '@angular/common/http';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-stock',
  templateUrl: './stock.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./stock.component.css']
})
export class StockComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor(private _stockService: StockService) { }

  itemAmount = 0;
  requestedAmount = 0;
  selectedItem = '';
  errorMessage = '';

  private items: StockItems[] = [];

  ngOnInit() {
    this.getStock();
  }

  getStock(): void {
    this._stockService.GetStock()
      .subscribe(data => {
        this.items = data;

        if (this.selectedItem !== '') {
          this.itemAmount = this.items.find(p => p.name === this.selectedItem).amount;
        }
      }
      );

    console.log(`Stock: ${this.items}`);
  }

  onRemoveStockClicked(): void {
    const newItem: StockItems = {
      name: this.selectedItem,
      amount: this.requestedAmount
    };

    this._stockService.RemoveStock(newItem)
      .subscribe(
        data => {
          this.errorMessage = '';
          this.getStock();
        },
        error => {
          const message: HttpErrorResponse = <any>error;
          this.errorMessage = message.error;
        });
  }

  onAddStockClicked(): void {
    const newItem: StockItems = {
      name: this.selectedItem,
      amount: this.requestedAmount
    };

    this._stockService.AddStock(newItem)
      .subscribe(
        data => {
          this.errorMessage = '';
          this.getStock();
        },
        error => {
          const message: HttpErrorResponse = <any>error;
          this.errorMessage = message.error;
        });
  }

  onSelectedItem(item): void {
    console.log(`You selected: ${item}`);
    this.itemAmount = this.items.find(p => p.name === item).amount;
    this.selectedItem = item;
  }

  onClicked(): void {
  }
}

```

``` typescript
export interface StockItems {
    name: string;
    amount: number;
}

```

So, build and run them and then test it out. When an items stock goes below 5, all connected clients will receive a notification!!
