<p>I published my new API changes to my Azure app and did the same for my Angular Web App, only to find that now I received a cross origin header error, because he web app and api were on different domains. However, I fixed this issue months ago when I first published them. So what changed? Well I can&rsquo;t say because I don&rsquo;t know. The published the last working version I had, and it still didn&rsquo;t work. Yay.</p>
<p>At first it looked like the problem I was getting was because I was using &lsquo;Content-type : application/json&rsquo; as a header, that apparently Cors doesn&rsquo;t accept (even though my app worked before), however it turns out i wasn&rsquo;t that.</p>
<p>So what else could it be? Well I Googled a lot and configured CORS in my api in multiple different ways according to the Google results, without any joy.</p>
<p>So what was it? Well, by fluke I was scrolling through the Azure web apps options, looking for the logs section (because we all know logs help), when I see a section called &lsquo;CORS&rsquo;! A quick peak in here, gives you an option to enter some allowed origins. So I put in my web apps url, save, restart the api app and bingo! I works!!!!</p>
<p>So what have a learnt? Well for starters, CORS is a huge area and there are lots that can be done with it. Most importantly though, Azure probably have a configuration setting for the issue you&rsquo;re having, so check there first.</p>
