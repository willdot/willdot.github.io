</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I was getting no objects returned from my filter. After a bit of head banging against my desk, I noticed that the JSON data was using camel case for the property names.</p>
<p>So I made a change and tried this instead, just to see what the outcome was.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-typescript" data-lang="typescript"><span style="display:flex;"><span>.<span style="color:#a6e22e">filter</span>(<span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span> <span style="color:#f92672">=&gt;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span>[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;week&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">weekNumber</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">a</span>[<span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;seasonType&#39;</span>] <span style="color:#f92672">==</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">seasonType</span>);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It worked, interesting. So instead of doing that, I went through all my Angular classes an changed all the property names to use camel case, switched back to my original filter code and everything worked.</p>
<p>Apparently, .Net api defaults to returning JSON in camel case, but there is a way to change this! Will give this a go later and see what happens.</p>
